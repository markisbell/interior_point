# Methods to solve optimizations problems with the Interior Point method
In this repo I would like to share some Matlab code to solve quadratic constraint optimization problems with quadratic cost. I find it quite interesting, that there are so few free solvers in Matlab code out there for this type of problem, even though it occurs quite frequently. I'm not in expert in Matlab syntax, so if anyone wants to participate in making this thing more convenient fell free to contact me. If you want to use the code for your project please go for it.
