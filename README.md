# Methods to solve optimizations problems with the Interior Point method
In this repo I would like to share some Matlab code to solve quadratic constraint optimization problems with quadratic cost. I find it quite interesting, that there are so few free solvers out there for this type of problem, even though it occurs quite frequently.
